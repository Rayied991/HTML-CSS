<!-- Relative
Elements are positioned relative to the normal position in the document.

You can use the top, right, bottom, and left properties to move the element from its original position.
Absolute
Elements are positioned relative to the closest positioned ancestor (parent), which means we need to have a parent
element with a positioning other than 'static'.
Fixed
Elements are positioned relative to the viewport (screen) and do not move when the page is scrolled.

This is useful for creating elements like fixed headers or footers.
Sticky
Position sticky is a hybrid between 'relative' and 'fixed'.

It allows an element to become "stuck" to the top or bottom of its container when scrolling, but it behaves like
relative positioning within the container until it reaches a specified offset. -->

Differences between Outlines and Borders:
While both can visually appear similar, outlines differ from borders in a few ways:

Position: Outlines don't take up space; they're drawn around the element, outside of any border.
Offset: Using the outline-offset property, you can set the space between an outline and the edge or border of an element.
Width: Borders can have varying widths on different sides, outlines have a uniform width.
Rounded Corners: Borders can have rounded corners using border-radius, while outlines generally cannot.
